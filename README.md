TravelXP is a fully self-developed website created using only HTML and CSS. <br>
This project showcases a clean and intuitive interface that guides users through the importance of travel, helps them explore top destinations, and provides options to book tickets and visualize flight routes. <br>
The primary goal behind this project was to assess and strengthen my foundational skills in front-end development, particularly in HTML and CSS. <br>
Every section, layout, and style in the website was hand-coded by me, emphasizing my attention to detail and design thinking. <br>
While it's currently static, future upgrades are already planned, including the integration of JavaScript for enhanced interactivity and dynamic features. <br>
TravelXP reflects my growing proficiency in web development and my ability to turn creative ideas into functional, user-friendly digital experiences.<br>
